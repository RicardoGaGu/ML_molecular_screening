## Virtual screening using ML methods

A set of small molecular compounds with measured ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication.
Each compound has label that determined whether is active or inactiv against the HIV-1 protein target.
## Dataset

Under data, you will find the HIV.csv that contains around 40.000 compounds with their corresponding labels.

## Requirements

Python >= 3.x installed in machine. Conda is the recommended way to handle virtual environments. Main packages that would be needed:

- pandas
- rdkit
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
